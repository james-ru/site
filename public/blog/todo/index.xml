      <description>Resources:  Mathematical proofs - a transition to advanced mathematics started: somewhere in the first week of July 2022, Switzerland trip. One small pitfall: I skipped a lot of exercices that were a lot of work or lengthy. Not smart.

  Sets  subset A set \(A\) is called a subset of a set \(B\) if every element of \(A\) also belongs to \(B\). Notation: \(A \subseteq B\) proper subset A set \(A\) is a proper subset of a set \(B\) if \(A \subseteq B\) but \(A \neq B\).</description>

Inner product spaces Definition An inner product space is a vector space with an inner product. Inner products can be seen as a generalization of the dot product, as dot products are only defined for \(\mathbb R\) and not other fields such as \(\mathbb C\).</description>
