There is a website obesity crisis. Bloated websites are full of scripts, ads, and trackers slowing your readers down every time they try to read your well-crafted content.
Bear is all you need to build a fantastic and optimized site or blog. It works perfectly on any viewing device. All you need to focus on is writing good content.</description>

 dual spaces explained  (image source: Chuang and Nielsen)
Inner product spaces Definition An inner product space is a vector space with an inner product. Inner products can be seen as a generalization of the dot product, as dot products are only defined for \(\mathbb R\) and not other fields such as \(\mathbb C\).
How is the inner product for complex vector spaces obtained? Let us consider the case of complex numbers to obtain this generalization.</description>

      <description>2. Russian Handwriting: More on Pronunciation 2.2 Word stress Just like in English, the stress of words can influence the pronunciation of words and must be memorized.
When a letter is stressed, it will be written with a `. The following letters change in &amp;lsquo;pronunciation&amp;rsquo;:
   letter not stressed stressed     о [а] [о]    2.5/2.6 Softness and hardness of consonants  Soft means that the consonant is pronounced with a simultaneous y sound Hard means pronounced like English consonants  Examples:</description>

      <description>The following table is an outline of the strength training blocks I&amp;rsquo;ve followed the past year and shows the weight progression I&amp;rsquo;ve had using the programs. As a rule of thumb, the weights indicated roughly correspond to my 1RM at the end of a block.
