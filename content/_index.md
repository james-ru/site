## About

Hi! I am a nanoengineering student with a focus on quantum engineering, materials and technology at KU Leuven. Recently, I completed my master's in electronics and ICT engineering technology where I did my thesis at SABCA on FPGA-based control systems.

The semiconductor industry piqued my interest after graduating and made me enroll in the nanotechnology program. I am predominantly interested in applying computational science to my field of study.
