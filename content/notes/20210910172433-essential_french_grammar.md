## How to Form Questions {#how-to-form-questions}


## A Glossary of Grammatical Terms in English {#a-glossary-of-grammatical-terms-in-english}

(based on English grammar)


### Parts of Speech {#parts-of-speech}

nouns
: things of all sorts - objects that you can see, ideas, places, qualities, groups, ...


adjectives
: give specific information about nouns - size, color, weight, pleasantness, ...


articles
: definite article _the_ and indefinite article _a_


verbs
: words that tell what action or condition/relationship is going on


adverbs
: word that supplies additional information about a verb, adjective or another adverb (now, then, there, anywhere) - most words ending with -ly are _ordinarily_ adverbs


pronouns
: mention persons/objects/ **nouns** in general and take their place

There exist several types of pronouns:

-   personal pronouns (I, we, mine, us, ours, you, yours, they, them, ...)
-   demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those)
-   interrogative pronouns (who, whom, what, whose, which)
-   relative pronouns (who, whom, that, which) refers back to something already mentioned
-   others: some, any, anyone, no one, other, ...

The same pronoun in different sentences can be of a different type. A question may be asked with an interrogative pronoun and answered with a relative pronoun. Some adjectives can also act as pronouns.

prepositions
: words that express spatial, temporal relations or semantic roles (in, beside, under, of, to, about)


conjunctions
: joining-words: and, but, although, ...


### Words about Verbs {#words-about-verbs}

infinitive
: basic form of a verb


tense
: time
    -   past
        -   simple past (I walked)
        -   **progressive** past (I was walking)
        -   perfect/present **perfect** (I have walked)
        -   past **perfect** /pluperfect (I had walked)
    -   present
        -   present (I walk)
        -   present **progressive** (I am walking)
    -   future
        -   simple future (I shall walk)
        -   future **progressive** (I shall be walking)

Participles are used in tenses.

**present participles**, progressive tenses
: present participles always end in -ing in English. I am _walking_, you are _walking_.
    -   The past progressive would be I was _walking_, you were _walking_.


**past participles**, perfect tenses
: past participle is sometimes formed by adding -ed or -d to the present tense (_walked_, _looked_, _received_, _seen_, _been_, _swum_). Form by filling out the sentence "I have ...".
    -   The perfect tenses (present perfect or past perfect) are _formed_ with the present tense of 'to have' and the **past participle** of a verb.


preterit, imperfect
:



auxiliary verbs
: special words to help other verbs to make their forms (have in the perfect tenses)


reflexive
: verb flexes back upon the noun or pronoun that is its subject. "He washes himself. He seated himself at the table". Has -self on its end.


passive
: more prominent in Latin: A-does-something-to B is active, B-is-having-something-done-to-him by A is passive
    -   active: John is building a house
    -   passive: A house is being built by John


impersonal verbs
: Some verbs don't have an ordinary subject or don't refer to persons (It is snowing)


### Words about Nouns {#words-about-nouns}

agreement

gender
: random assignment of gender to lots of nouns (masculine/feminine/neuter)


comparative, superlative
: degree of strength within the meaning of the word with adjectives and adverbs.
    -   comparatives: use -er or more as an adjective or adverb (faster, better, earlier, newer, more rapid, more detailed, ...)

    -   superlatives: forms which end in -est or have "most' prefixed (most intelligent, earliest, most rapidly)


idiom
: expression that is peculiar to a language


### The Parts of the Sentence {#the-parts-of-the-sentence}

subject, predicate
: the thing being talked about, the predicate talks aobut the subject

direct and indirect objects
: direct object is the thing or matter that the verb directs its action upon, always follows the verb. The indirect object is the person or thing for or to whom the action is taking place. "Please tell _me_ the time. I wrote _her_ a letter from Barcelona".

### Passé composé {#passé-composé}

= voltooid tegenwoordige tijd, past indefinite tense

"Ik heb gelopen"
"I spoke, I finished, I bought" and "I have spoken, I have finished, I have bought"

-   present tense of avoir + _past participle_
-   voltooid deelwoord, "Ik heb _gelopen_"

    vaak als het een beweging verklaart, is het een woord van het huis!

    `deze worden ook extra vervoegd`

#### Imperfect tense vs passé composé {#imperfect-tense-vs-passé-composé}

Imperfect describes actions that _used to happen_, repeatedly or regularly, or actions which were taking place when something else happened.

The passé composé is used to describe single rather than repeated actions, and generally actions which are considered completed.

Je le voyais tous les jours. (I used to see him everyday, l'imparfait)
Je l'ai vu hier. (I saw him yesterday)

Qui faisier-vous (_l'imparfait_) quand il vous a téléphoné (_passé composé_)? (What were you doing when he called you?)
Qu'avez-vous fait quand il vous a téléphoné? (passé composé, what did you do when he called you?)
